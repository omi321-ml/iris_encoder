📘 Overview

This project explores the famous Iris dataset — one of the most popular datasets in data science and machine learning.
It demonstrates data visualization, analysis, and model building using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

🎯 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset

Visualize patterns and relationships between features

Build and evaluate a simple machine learning model for flower classification

🧠 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, divided into 3 species:

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

Each sample includes:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python 3.x

Pandas – for data handling

NumPy – for numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualization

Scikit-learn – for machine learning

📊 Key Features

✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing
✅ Correlation heatmap and pairplot visualizations
✅ Classification model (e.g., Decision Tree / Logistic Regression)
✅ Model accuracy evaluation

🖼️ Sample Visualizations

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris_conder.git
cd iris_conder


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the script or notebook

python iris_analysis.py


or open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook iris_analysis.ipynb

📈 Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy in predicting iris flower species based on the given measurements.
Visualizations clearly distinguish between the three iris species using feature combinations.

🧩 Future Improvements

Try other ML algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, KNN)

Deploy model as a web app (using Flask or Streamlit)

Add interactive dashboard visualizations
